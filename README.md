ES6 introduced a new way of writing JavaScript functions called arrow function that uses a fat arrow ( => ).

The arrow function has a lexical scoping to this context.
The arrow function syntax is heavily seen when using callback functions.

This is where the arrow function comes into play. They donâ€™t have their own this context. When used inside the outer (enclosing) function, this keyword will point to where the function is present.
